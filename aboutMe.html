    <h1>About Cate</h1>

    <body>
       <p> Hi!! I'm Cate. I'm a computer science major. I love love love ice cream -- chunky monkey from ben and jerrys is the best. 
        I've played so many sports but my favorites are basketball and horseback riding.
        I wanted to try out for the equestrian team here but the NCAA disbanded it lol.
        I'm from Maryland but I'm a big New York / Jersey girl so I am living my best life right now. 
        I can't wait for the next four years and I'm excited to see how the rest of the semester turns out! </p>
